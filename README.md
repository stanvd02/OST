Hi there!

I developped a site called OST as a single dev. Its basically a code free site for anyone who likes to be creative. This site if ofcourse 100% withouth ads.

I currently offer 2 applications.

Python Visual Coder Here
Pages - Web page hoster Here
New apps? (contact me)

Python visual coder
Python visual coder is a coder based on googleâ€™s code blocks IDE. It is verry simple to use and has all neccesary functions even including TKinter for UI building. This is still in Beta, so please report any issues you are having.

Pages
Pages is a securely stored https service that will allow you to host any html online. These pages are moderated to stop abuse (if suspicous activity is detected), but appart from that its the perfect place to host simple web pages, for example if you need to redirect your app somewhere.

Help is appreciated!
I would love any kind of help, from feedback to application ideas to full on applications. Leave a comment below or contact me via stanvandorsten@gmail.com. Feel free to contact me if you would want your page online if you think it would bennefit the community

I was thinking about making a plugin database, so its verry easy to find plugins uploaded to kodular community, however i am not sure what your thoughts are about this.

The site: OST: Empowering innovation through open collaboration

This site is secured with authentication by firebase.

Thank you for reading this far :slight_smile:
